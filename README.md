- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new tools and techniques in the field of data science.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to data analysis and machine learning.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, data preprocessing, predictive modeling, or any data science-related topics.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy solving puzzles and playing strategy games in my free time.

## Skills

- Programming: Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn), SQL
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, PowerBI
- Machine Learning: Regression, Classification, Clustering
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git

## Projects

### Monty Hall Simulator
- The Monty Hall Simulator is a Python-based program that simulates the Monty Hall problem, a famous probability puzzle demonstrating counterintuitive results in decision-making.
- Users can select one out of three doors and the program simulates the host opening a door, revealing a goat. The option to switch the chosen door or stick with the original choice is provided, followed by revealing whether the user wins a car or not.
- To explore the code or run the Monty Hall Simulator, please visit the [Monty-Hall-Simulator Repository](https://github.com/Timmapuram-Karthik/Monty-Hall-Simulator)

### Tic Tac Toe
- Developed a classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python with a user-friendly interface, dynamic board updates, and accurate win determination.
- Implemented a command-line interface that allows two players to compete against each other, selecting 'X' or 'O', and making moves by choosing cell numbers on the board.
- Validated user inputs to prevent invalid moves and provided real-time feedback on game outcomes, including declaring the winner or announcing a draw.

### Gender Classification Model
- The Gender Classification Model utilizes the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict the gender of individuals based on facial features such as long hair, forehead width, nose width, lips thinness, and more.
- Trained on a labeled dataset, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of 97% on the testing data, making it highly effective in gender prediction.
