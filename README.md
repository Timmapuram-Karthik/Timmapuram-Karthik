# Hello, I'm T Karthik ðŸ‘‹

Passionate Data Scientist | Python Programmer | Machine Learning Enthusiast



## About Me

I am a dedicated data science enthusiast pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree. With a strong background in Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning, I love working with complex datasets to uncover valuable insights and develop data-driven solutions.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on sharpening my skills in machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new tools and techniques in the field of data science.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to data analysis and machine learning.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, data preprocessing, predictive modeling, or any data science-related topics.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy solving puzzles and playing strategy games in my free time.

## Skills

- Programming: Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn), SQL
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
- Machine Learning: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Deep Learning
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, Docker

## Project: 
1. **Monty Hall Simulator**
- The Monty Hall Simulator is a Python-based program that simulates the Monty Hall problem. The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle that demonstrates   counterintuitive results in decision-making.

- The simulator allows users to select one out of three doors and then simulates the host opening one of the remaining doors, revealing a goat behind it. Finally,    the program provides the option to switch the chosen door or stick with the original choice, followed by revealing whether the user wins a car or not.

- To explore the code or run the Monty Hall Simulator, please visit the [Monty-Hall-Simulator](https://github.com/Timmapuram-Karthik/Monty-Hall-Simulator).

- Feel free to check it out, leave feedback, or contribute to the project!
