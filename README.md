- Data Analysis and Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, PowerBI
- Machine Learning: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Deep Learning
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git

## Projects

### Monty Hall Simulator
- The Monty Hall Simulator is a Python-based program that simulates the Monty Hall problem, a famous probability puzzle demonstrating counterintuitive results in decision-making.
- Users can select one out of three doors and the program simulates the host opening a door, revealing a goat. The option to switch the chosen door or stick with the original choice is provided, followed by revealing whether the user wins a car or not.
- To explore the code or run the Monty Hall Simulator, please visit the [Monty-Hall-Simulator Repository](https://github.com/Timmapuram-Karthik/Monty-Hall-Simulator)

### Tic Tac Toe
- Developed a classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python with a user-friendly interface, dynamic board updates, and accurate win determination.
- Implemented a command-line interface that allows two players to compete against each other, selecting 'X' or 'O', and making moves by choosing cell numbers on the board.
- Validated user inputs to prevent invalid moves and provided real-time feedback on game outcomes, including declaring the winner or announcing a draw.
